         <p class="about-text">
          Anthony Arg端ello, has an innate passion for nature. Exploring it,
          photographing it, and creating adventures in the process are only a few
          of the things that drive him to keep moving.</p><br>

          <p class="about-text-quote">"We live in scary times. Uncertainty about
            if we will have our planet as we know ir or not in th future,
            used to be nothing but a movie motive. Now this has become our reality.
            I believe there is a huge need for change, we need to wake up to the
            fact that is in our hands to make our future a better place to live."
          <br/>-Anthony Arg端ello</p><br>

          <p class="about-text"  >Arg端ello has been working on his art for the past couple
            of years hoping to not only bring people to become aware of the beauty
            that lies in nature, but it's real value and importance to us as humans.
            Arg端ello is constantly seeking for the path of self-improvement in order to have a
            voice that would reach those who haven't heard and understand the importance
            of treating our planet as our only home. A voice that will break our old
            paradigms and replace them with new ones, full of respect and appreciation
            for nature and all what it gives us.
